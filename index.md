# Overview
Seequent is a software services company that serves the geoscientific community through the development and support of advanced geoscientific workflows for sub-surface investigations.  Seequent's technology includes the Geosoft Oasis montaj platform and related technologies, for which Geosoft GX Developer is the primary API  for developers to work with Geosoft components.

This documentation describes Geosoft GX Developer, which can be used to extend the capabilities of Seequent's Geosoft platforms, create stand-alone programs that read and/or write to Geosoft supported file formats.  The Geosoft API can be accessed from the Geosoft GX Language, 64-bit Python (3.5 minimum) or any [CLI language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages) (e.g. C#, VB, C++/CLI, F#).
